# Data Migration and Transformation Script

This project is a Python script designed to facilitate the migration and transformation of data from a MongoDB database to a PostgreSQL database. The script performs various data cleaning and restructuring tasks to ensure the data is in an optimal state for storage and querying in PostgreSQL.

## Features

- **Data Extraction**: Connects to a MongoDB database and retrieves the necessary data.
- **Data Cleaning**: Removes duplicate records and handles incomplete records by either removing them or filling in missing values.
- **Data Transformation**: Changes the structure of the data to fit the schema required by the PostgreSQL database.
- **Fixture Creation**: Generates fixtures that are compatible with PostgreSQL for easy data import.
